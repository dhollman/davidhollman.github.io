Hi there.  Welcome to my website.  It's not much for now, but I hope to expand it in the future.  For now, it's just a list of my talks and publications.  Check back later for more!

## Bio

Here's a little bio-blurb, since it feels like I should have something like that here:

I have been involved in the ISO-C++ standard committee since 2016.  He has been a part of a number of different papers in that time, including `mdspan`, `atomic_ref`, and—most prominently—executors and futures.  Since finishing my Ph.D. in computational quantum chemistry at the University of Georgia in 2013, I have mostly worked on programming models for computational science, data science, and related fields.  I joined Sandia National Labs in 2014 and have worked on several different programming models projects since then.
